The problem is related to the extensive use of the cell method in read-only mode. 
In read-only mode openpyxl reads the relevant worksheet on-demand to reduce memory use low but means 
that for every lookup the XML will be parsed again. 
The code you have rewritten forces openpyxl to reparse the file for every cell in every row which is obviously slow. 
This is also entirely unnecessary because there is an API for row-based access. 
Just use ws.iter_rows() with the relevant delimiters to get cells you want.
