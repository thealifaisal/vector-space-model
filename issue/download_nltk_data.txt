So, supposing my python application is in a directory called "myapp/"

-------------- Step 1: Create the directory

>cd myapp/
>mkdir nltk_data

-------------- Step 2: Download Corpus to New Directory

>python -m nltk.downloader

This'll pop up the nltk downloader. Set your Download Directory to whatever_the_absolute_path_to_myapp_is/nltk_data/. If you're using the GUI downloader, the download directory is set through a text field on the bottom of the UI. If you're using the command line one, you set it in the config menu.

Once the downloader knows to point to your newly created nltk_data directory, download your corpus.

Or in one step from Python code:

>nltk.download("wordnet", "whatever_the_absolute_path_to_myapp_is/nltk_data/")

-------------- Step 3: Let nltk Know Where to Look

ntlk looks for data,resources,etc. in the locations specified in the nltk.data.path variable.
All you need to do is add nltk.data.path.append('./nltk_data/') to the python file actually using nltk,
and it will look for corpora, tokenizers, and such in there in addition to the default paths.
