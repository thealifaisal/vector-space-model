------------------ background ------------------

this search-engine is based on vector-space-model 
and uses the 'cache' technique to store the calculated doc vectors
and bag-of-words in a file named '../out/tf-idf.xlsx'

------------------ execution time analysis ------------------

Assumptions: 

	1: CPU = 3.4 Ghz Base-Clock * 4
	2: RAM = 8 GB

------------------ when cache not found ------------------

calculations took 8 seconds of which:
5 seconds for documents preprocessing
3 seconds for documents tf-idf calculations

the whole program with query executed in 18 seconds.

------------------ when cache found ------------------

a) loading the workbook/cache in read and write mode

	02:06:02: appending nltk_data path to nltk`data-path...
	02:06:02: checking cache...
	02:06:07: cache found and loaded
	02:06:07: length of bag-of-words = 6015
	02:06:07: initiating pre-processing of query...
	02:06:10: query pre-processing completed
	02:06:10: query lemma-set > {'biggest': 1, 'plane': 1, 'wanted': 1, 'hour': 1}
	02:06:10: initiating query tf-idf calculations...
	02:06:10: completed query tf-idf calculations...
	02:06:10: creating result set...
	02:06:12: result set created
	02:06:12: writing result-set to ../out/result_set.txt...
	02:06:12: result-set written to ../out/result_set.txt
	02:06:12: cache-file closed
	02:06:12: exit


cache loading took 5 seconds without extra CPU utilization.
the whole program with query executed in 10 seconds.

Hence, cache usage gives a performance improvement of 8 seconds.
